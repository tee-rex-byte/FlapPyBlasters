===============

A reimagined Flappy Bird clone where you can flap, navigate through pipes, and destroy obstacles using blasters!

> Made from a Flappy Bird Clone - [FlapPyBird](https://github.com/sourabhv/FlapPyBird) made using [python-pygame]





Setup (as tested Windows x64)
---------------------------

1. Install Python 3 from [here](https://www.python.org/download/releases/) (or use brew/apt/pyenv)

2. Run `make init` (this will install pip packages, use virtualenv or something similar if you don't want to install globally)

3. Run `make` to run the game. Run `DEBUG=True make` to see rects and cords

4. Use <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> key to play and <kbd>Esc</kbd> to close the game.

5. Optionally run `make web` to run the game in the browser (`pygbag`).
